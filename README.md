# FileNewer
FileNewer is my attempt at making alternative to windows default file explorer, using C++ and ImGUI.

The project's key aims are to address my main gripes with the default file explorer:
- [ ] Indexing speed
- [ ] Search speed
- [ ] Navigation speed
- [ ] PowerShell integration

*Feel free to suggest more improvments to add*
